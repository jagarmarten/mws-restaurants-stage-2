# Mobile web specialist - Udacity nanodegree stage 2 project

This is my stage 2 project - restaurant reviews.

The url to the website, where you can see the project live is http://jagarmarten.github.io/mws-restaurants-stage-2/

This project uses service worker and indexedDB (promised) which makes it more accessible for mobile devices.

To make this project work, you also need to download https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-2 and use **node server** to start the server.
